# YakV
### -Yak Vertical-

YakV is an app for **calulate your vertical** jump and details about it for now.

The idea is to develop an ***fitness app open-source for athletes*** with out any limitation for basic things.

Like merge all little things in one app(traker,diary,traningtools,community, etc), it would be perfect if it will have android-pc sync.

*I'm a newbie but I will learn a lot with this, a help isn't so bad exepacially for android develop*
